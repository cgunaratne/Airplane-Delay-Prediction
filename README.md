# Airplane-Delay-Prediction
I contributed to a group project on predicting airplane delays using Kaggle data. I performed k-means clustering to uncover insights, revealing patterns and groupings that provided valuable analysis. This helped us understand the factors behind delays and improve future predictions.

I have been working on this project, and I have made significant progress thus far, as reflected in the notebook provided. My plan is to complete the project by the first week of April.
