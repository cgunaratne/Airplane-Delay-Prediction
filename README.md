# Airplane-Delay-Prediction
I'm contributing to a group project on predicting airplane delays using Kaggle data. I have been performing k-means clustering to uncover insights, revealing patterns and groupings that provided valuable analysis. This is helping us understand the factors behind delays and improve future predictions.

I have made significant progress thus far, as reflected in the notebook provided (k-cluster.ipynb). My plan is to complete the project by the first week of April.
